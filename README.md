# NeuralNetworks
Contains Neural Network implementation from scratch. A python library mainly designed for my own use. Eventual implementation of various types of neural networks, supervised and unsupervised learning and other machine learning features from scratch.

Currently implemented:
 - feed-forward neural networks
 - GUI for said networks
 
 Current Problems:
  - approach limited by missing optimisation.
  
 Planned Fix:
  - use of the numba library to access the cuda framework and use GPU to make calculations.
