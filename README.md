# NeuralNetworks
## Discontinued due to Performance Issues

Contains Neural Network implementation from scratch. A python library mainly designed for my own use. Feed-Forward Neural Networks (with backpropagation or other learning method) from scratch. Interfaces are also implemented.

Currently implemented:
 - feed-forward neural networks
 - GUI for said networks
 
 Problems:
  - approach limited by devices available and CPU-based approach.
  - limited optimisation
